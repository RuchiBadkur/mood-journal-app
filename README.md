A simple mood journaling app built with **React Native**, **Expo**, and **TypeScript**. This beginner-level project allows users to log daily moods and journal entries.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## 🎨 Brief Design Rationale

The app focuses on simplicity and beginner-friendly design:

- A clean home screen with a list of journal entries.
- Use of emoji to visually represent moods.
- Easy navigation with a bottom tab bar.
- NativeWind used for quick and consistent styling.

## 🧠 Usability Heuristics Focused On

Based on [Nielsen Norman Group’s 10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/), this app implements:

1. **Visibility of System Status** – The home screen immediately displays journal entries with mood and date.
2. **Match Between System and the Real World** – Uses everyday terms like “Happy,” “Sad,” and emojis for better user resonance.
3. **User Control and Freedom** – Clear navigation options with add/edit capability (via icon buttons).
4. **Consistency and Standards** – Native UI patterns and consistent styling with NativeWind.
5. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design** – Focused on essential info only: mood, title, and date.

## 📦 iOS Build with EAS
– ⚠️ Note: Unable to complete iOS build using EAS Build as it requires Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year), which I currently do not have access to.
